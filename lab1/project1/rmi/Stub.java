/** RMI stub factory.

    <p>
    RMI stubs hide network communication with the remote server and provide a
    simple object-like interface to their users. This class provides methods for
    creating stub objects dynamically, when given pre-defined interfaces.

    <p>
    The network address of the remote server is set when a stub is created, and
    may not be modified afterwards. Two stubs are equal if they implement the
    same interface and carry the same remote server address - and would
    therefore connect to the same skeleton. Stubs are serializable.

        This method should be used when the stub is created together with the
        skeleton. The stub may then be transmitted over the network to enable
        communication with the skeleton.

                 implemented by the remote object.

                                      address by the user and has not yet been

        This method should be used when the stub is created together with the

        automatically assigning a valid externally-routable address to the

        obtaining an externally-routable address by other means, and specifying
